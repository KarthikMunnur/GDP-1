                            had lots of experience working with horses but never much in the show world. The
                            opportunities that the IHSA gives to students is extremely worthwhile. It has opened doors
                            for me that I didn’t think were possible before entering the collegiate show world. The

                          major at Rocky Mountain College. When I began my search for colleges I knew that my heart was
                          set on horses and I wanted to compete. When I came for a college tour I met all the equestrian
                          trainers and professors and fell in love with all of them. They all made me feel welcomed and
                          supported along with seeing my potential and knowing I can become the best rider I can be.
                          Rocky Mountain College is a smaller school which I also fell in love with. I knew I wanted to
                          create a relationship with my trainers and professors rather than just be a number. Everyone
                          in the equestrian program makes me feel as if this is my second home.</p></div>

                        <div class="featured-rider__description"><p>Serinah Palafox is a member of the class of 2023 at
                          Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York. Serinah is from Staten Island and rode on the MET IEA
                          team with Jane DaCosta who encouraged and mentored her. She earned a significant scholarship
                          for her undergraduate studies.<br>
                          <br>
                          At Hartwick she continued riding on the IHSA team. Her first two years of competition were
                          sidelined because of COVID-19, but in 2022, Serinah qualified for and competed at
                          Regionals.<br>
                          <br>
                          “Making it to Regional Finals was a dream come true,” Serinah said. “I want to thank the IHSA
                          for providing me the opportunity to continue my riding career throughout my academic college
                          career, for creating countless memories with teammates, meeting new people in and out of the
                          saddle, and reconnecting with former IEA teammates while cheering them on. My favorite part of
                          IHSA is the family I found and all the amazing horses I’ve learned from and come across.
                          Without riding I don’t think I’d be where I am today, so thank you!”</p>

                          <p><span>My name is Kaylee Tingle and I am a junior at Midway University. I plan to graduate
                              in the spring of 2023. I grew up in Henry County, Kentucky, where I participated in a
                              variety of sports during high school. I have been riding Quarter Horses and showing
                              competively in the AQHA circuit since I was 9 years old. I joined the Midway University
                              Equestrian Western team as a freshman and have gained lots of diverse riding experiences.
                            </span></p>
                          <p><span>Showing in the IHSA has helped me become the rider I am today. IHSA has given me the
                              opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. I have made so many memories and I
                              have been very successful competing in IHSA, but none of this would be possible without
                              the help and support from my teammates and my coach, Conner Smith. My favorite IHSA memory
                              was being apart of Midway’s Western team region win in 2019-2020. Although every IHSA show
                              with my team is very memorable, winning the region has to be my favorite!&nbsp;</span></p>

                            </strong>Catch riding all types of horses—you never know what horse you'll get! Discussing
                            how to best ride each horse and getting advice from all my teammates early in the morning of
                            a show always leaves me feeling reassured and ready. Also having my teammates and
                            coaches&nbsp;cheer ringside as placings are called makes me feel like a valued member of our
                            team and IHSA as a whole.</p>
                          <p><strong>How has IHSA enhanced your college experience?<br>
                            </strong>I have been on the Wisconsin Equestrian Team since my first semester of freshman
                            year. I have served on the executive board since then and loved it—I am dedicated to my
                            teammates, coaches, and horses. College would be a much tougher experience if I did not have
                            the barn and horses to escape to on a weekly basis. IHSA has let me be a part of a group of
                            people that are constantly encouraging growth and supporting me inside and outside of the
                            ring, and I am so grateful for that.</p>

                          <p>I’m a sophomore at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. I compete in Intermediate
                            Western Horsemanship and World Equestrian Center Limit Hunter on the Flat and Over Fences. I
                            am the Team Secretary for our school. OSU is located in Zone 8 on the West Coast in region
                            4, where we compete against schools from Washington and British Columbia. I’m originally
                            from Gresham, Oregon, which is just outside Portland, where I grew up riding Western. I’m
                            majoring in Animal Science with an Equine and Beef Production option and I’m expecting to
                            graduate spring of 2022.&nbsp;</p>

                          <p>My favorite thing about IHSA is all the lifelong connections I’ve made in the horse world
                            with equine professionals across the country and also the friends I’ve made from many
                            different schools. It’s a wonderful showing experience that pulls in people from all walks
                            of life whether they’ve been showing forever or just started in college. It also is a
                            wonderful way to gain experience riding many different horses of different breeds. If it
                            were not for the IHSA, I wouldn’t have otherwise had the opportunity. IHSA has enhanced my
                            college experience immensely due to the head start of my career in the horse world and the
                            relationships I have made. I want to thank IHSA because I have become a more confident rider
                            and student because of this experience.&nbsp;</p><br>

                          <p>I’m a senior biology major, minoring in recreation at Georgia Southern University,
                            graduating spring 2020. I’m from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, where I grew up riding in
                            IEA and not really ever having a horse of my own. I love the challenge of riding new horses
                            and feel like it is a true test of horsemanship. I found out about Georgia Southern while
                            competing at their farm for IEA and fell in love with the school. I compete in Limit Over
                            Fences and Intermediate on the Flat. My favorite part of IHSA is the family I found. I can
                            always depend on my teammates, in and out of the barn. I also love seeing my friends from
                            different schools at competitions and cheering them on. IHSA has given me so many
                            opportunities from simply continuing my riding career, to being a team officer, to being on
                            the region ethics board. I am so grateful for this organization.</p>

                          <p>I am from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and I am studying biochemistry and math on a
                            pre-med track. I brought my personal horses with me to school to balance studying and my
                            love of horses. My riding background is mostly in starting young horses under saddle or
                            riding problem horses for people, which worked well because the show ring gave me severe
                            anxiety. Regretfully, I waited until my senior year to join the IHSA team. I love everything
                            about it. My team is an amazing group of people who love and support me. The show
                            environment is competitive but in a very fun and encouraging kind of way. I cannot believe
                            how much my confidence in the ring grew through this experience. I competed in the novice
                            hunter seat division, and I jocularly became known as the rider who looked for tight inside
                            turns as a way to spice up the course. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it backfired, but I
                            always had fun trying. I even made friends from other schools and looked forward to seeing
                            them at the shows. I am overall just very thankful to all who make IHSA possible because I
                            will never forget my season on the University of Scranton Equestrian Team. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <div class="featured-rider__description">I started riding nine years ago when my mom bought a
                          Quarter Horse for our family. I quickly got into a very competitive environment. Not only did
                          I love the animals, but also the challenge of how much coordination, strength and feel are
                          required when maneuvering them. I have been on the National Youth Team of Norway for four
                          years, and together we won Scandinavian Team Cups and placed second in the European Team Cup.
                          The highlight was in 2014 when we placed 4th in the AQHA Youth World Cup in Texas. <br><br>I
                          have always enjoyed being on a team where you have people around you who support you and have
                          your best interests at heart. Also, you feel like you contribute to something that is bigger
                          than yourself. With that in mind, I fell in love with the idea of being on a college
                          equestrian team. <br><br>Making the move from Norway to North Carolina to study and compete
                          ISHA has been the best decision of my life. As an IHSA rider you need to be confident in your
                          abilities, yet take nothing for granted. The most important thing I have learned as an IHSA
                          rider is to ride every stride with confidence and feel. In the future, I wish to take this
                          ability and turn it into my profession, as I would love to work as a horse trainer.<br></div>

                            am also the equestrian team’s hunter seat co-captain. I am from Benton, Pennsylvania, and I

                          <p>Before IHSA, most of my experience was in the hunter ring, however, I do enjoy dressage and
                            cross country. When I was asked why I love IHSA, I could think of million reasons why, but
                            it’s harder to explain your love for showing in one paragraph. I love riding in the IHSA,
                            not only because I am able to continue riding throughout my academic career in college, but
                            because you can learn so much about yourself as a rider. Each show and class presents a new
                            horse and a new challenge. You learn your strengths, how to improve upon your weaknesses and
                            even learn something you have never known. And even when you are cheering your teammates on
                            from outside the ring, you are watching other riders with such a wide range of skills. You
                            can never stop learning. <br></p>

                            that are encouraging and motivational. I think competing for the IHSA is unique because we
                            draw a horse that we may have never ridden before. Then we compete on that horse, for the
                            opportunity to earn points for ourselves and our team. I am also grateful for the
                            leadership, communication and management skills that I have acquired from the collegiate

                          <p>I am currently a junior at Texas State. I started riding horses at age 6 and got my first
                            horse at age 12. She is still my only horse and we’ve been together for 10 years. I mostly
                            rode western (barrel racing/gymkhana) but decided to try my hand at hunter seat when I moved
                            to Central Texas from Southern California last fall. I have fallen
                            head-over-tall-boots-heels in love with the discipline! Thanks to the incredible coaching
                            from Texas State Equestrian’s coach Katherine Deichmann, I brought home a couple
                            primary-colored ribbons last season in the Walk-Trot-Canter, advanced division. I loved
                            being on the team so much that I decided to run for captain, and lo and behold, I was
                            elected! I’m looking forward to the 2018/2019 year with Texas State Equestrian and IHSA. My
                            main goal is to point out of W/T/C and move up into the Novice division.&nbsp;</p>

                            presents, because you can't become too used to riding one horse. You have to learn to adapt
                            and ride a horse that you've never really interacted with before while riding at a
                            competitive level, which is difficult in and of itself. That forces
                            you to be more aware of not only the horse you are
                            riding, but also yourself. You can't change the horse to fit your own riding style, but
                            instead, you have to fit your riding style to the horse that you're on.</p>

                            Intermediate team rider and placed 7th overall. In 2015, I pointed up to Novice and began
                            showing the Novice for our team. I also qualified to show the Individual Intermediate and
                            went on to win Regionals, Semi-Finals, and Nationals. In 2015, I also placed 4th in the Team
                            Novice at Nationals. In 2016, I pointed up to the Advanced class and began showing the
                            Advanced for our team. Pointing up to the Advanced also qualified me to compete in the
                            Individual Novice. In 2016, I won Regionals, Semi-Finals, and Nationals in the Individual
                            Novice. In 2017, I continued showing the Advanced and am currently still showing in the
                            Advanced class and hope to keep excelling to compete in the Open. Showing at St. Andrews
                            University has taught me so much about being a horseman, allowed me to meet many influential
                            individuals, and has also helped me to make some of my dreams come true. None of the teams’
                            success could be possible without Carla Wennberg or Lindsey Trockenbrot.</p>
